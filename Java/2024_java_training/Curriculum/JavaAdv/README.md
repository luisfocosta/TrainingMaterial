# Advanced Java Programming
### Version 17

Example, demo, and lab projects for the "Java Programming"  course are found here. You can use this folder as the root of an Eclipse workspace, and import each subfolder as an "existing Maven project;" or open each subfolder separately in IntelliJ as you work through the course.

### Setup

1. Copy this folder and all subfolders to a separate location on your local file system.

1. Open individual projects in your IDE of choice. These are plain Java projects -- no Maven, no external libraries, just a JDK is required to open and use them.
