Four
score
and
seven
years
ago
our
fathers
brought
forth
this
continent
new
nation
conceived
Liberty
and
dedicated
the
proposition
that
all
men
are
created
equal
Now
are
engaged
great
civil
war
testing
whether
that
nation
any
nation
conceived
and
dedicated
can
long
endure
are
met
great
battle-field
that
war
have
come
dedicate
portion
that
field
final
resting
place
for
those
who
here
gave
their
lives
that
that
nation
might
live
altogether
fitting
and
proper
that
should
this
But
larger
sense
can
not
dedicate
can
not
consecrate
can
not
hallow
this
ground
The
brave
men
living
and
dead
who
struggled
here
have
consecrated
far
above
our
poor
power
add
detract
The
world
will
little
note
nor
long
remember
what
say
here
but
can
never
forget
what
they
did
here
for
the
living
rather
dedicated
here
the
unfinished
work
which
they
who
fought
here
have
thus
far
nobly
advanced
rather
for
here
dedicated
the
great
task
remaining
before
that
from
these
honored
dead
take
increased
devotion
that
cause
for
which
they
gave
the
last
full
measure
devotion
that
here
highly
resolve
that
these
dead
shall
not
have
died
vain
that
this
nation
under
God
shall
have
new
birth
freedom
and
that
government
the
people
the
people
for
the
people
shall
not
perish
from
the
earth
